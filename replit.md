## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The client-side is built with React and TypeScript using Vite as the build tool. The UI follows a modern component-based architecture:

- **Component Library**: Uses shadcn/ui components built on top of Radix UI primitives for consistent, accessible UI elements
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming, supporting both light and dark modes
- **State Management**: React Query (@tanstack/react-query) for server state management and caching
- **Routing**: Uses wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for type-safe form handling
- **File Structure**: Organized with separate directories for components, pages, hooks, and utilities

### Backend Architecture
The server is an Express.js application with TypeScript:

- **API Design**: RESTful API endpoints for surveys, observations, and photos
- **File Uploads**: Multer middleware for handling image uploads with size and type restrictions
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling middleware with structured error responses
- **Logging**: Custom request logging middleware for API endpoints
- **Development**: Vite integration for hot module replacement in development

### Data Storage Solutions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Schema**: Well-structured relational schema with surveys, observations, and observation photos tables
- **Connection**: Uses Neon serverless PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for database schema management and migrations
- **File Storage**: Local file system storage for uploaded images (uploads directory)

### Authentication and Authorization
The current implementation does not include authentication mechanisms, suggesting this may be added later or handled externally.

### Development and Build Process
- **Monorepo Structure**: Shared schema and types between client and server in the `/shared` directory
- **TypeScript**: Strict TypeScript configuration with path mapping for clean imports
- **Build Process**: Vite for client bundling, esbuild for server bundling
- **Development**: Concurrent development with Vite dev server and TSX for server hot reloading

## External Dependencies

### Database Services
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL hosting with WebSocket connections
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database toolkit for PostgreSQL operations

### UI and Component Libraries
- **Radix UI**: Headless, accessible UI components for complex interactions
- **shadcn/ui**: Pre-built component library based on Radix UI
- **Lucide React**: Icon library for consistent iconography

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Fast build tool with HMR for development
- **TypeScript**: Static type checking across the entire application
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **PostCSS**: CSS processing with Autoprefixer

### Runtime Dependencies
- **React Query**: Server state management and caching
- **React Hook Form**: Form state management with validation
- **Zod**: Runtime type validation and schema definition
- **date-fns**: Date manipulation and formatting utilities
- **wouter**: Lightweight routing library for React

### File Upload and Processing
- **Multer**: Express middleware for handling multipart/form-data and file uploads
- **File System**: Node.js fs/promises for server-side file operations

The application uses a modern, type-safe tech stack optimized for developer experience and maintainability, with careful attention to UI/UX through accessible component libraries and responsive design patterns.
